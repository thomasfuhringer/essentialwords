# Essential Words
## for the traveller in various languages

Rumor has it that Heinrich Harrer, when he travelled through remote places of the world, had a list of 70 words that he got himself translated into the local language of each place he went. Those 70 words allowed him basic communication with the locals. 

I tried to unearth that list but did not manage to. Eventually I put together a list of my own. I started out with published statistics of most used words in different languages. Unfortunately they are usually based on written material and my focus is faciliting oral communication. Also, I do not think much of those word lists typically found at the back of travel guides. They are mostly phrases and these are unnecessarily complicated for the purpose of just communicating with minimal investment into the language.
So I just made up a list of words based on my recollection of words I usually grasp for in the very initial stage of communicating in a new language. As a starting point I used Google Translate and revised those languages I know. Now I am hoping to put together a nice collection of most essential words in a number of languages.
